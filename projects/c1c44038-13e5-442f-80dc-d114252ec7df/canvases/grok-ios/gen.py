"""Grok for iOS -- seven screens, the tokens behind them, and the captures.

Regenerates the whole folder in place, byte-identically, from anywhere:

    python3 canvases/grok-ios/gen.py
    refkit tokens canvases/grok-ios

Every colour and every metric in here was read off five Mobbin captures at
2.2417 capture px per design pt (881 px across a 393 pt screen, 1910 down an
852 pt one) and two native captures at exactly 3 px per pt (1290 x 2796, a
430 x 932 pt Pro Max screen), and every one of them is stated with its
evidence on the 00b-00f boards. Nothing was eyeballed. The artboards are output: never hand-edit an
.html, edit this file and re-run.

Four decisions the captures force.

TWO DEVICES. 01-05 are 393 x 852 boards like every other folder here; 06-07
were captured on a 430 x 932 device and are drawn at that size, which fills
the 478 x 980 artboard exactly with the 24px padding (the bezel rings fit, the
drop shadow is clipped). Their status bar and Dynamic Island are this repo's
template frame, not the captures' (the captures show 20:52, a muted bell and a
live-activity glyph in the island; none of that is the app), and they carry no
home indicator because the captures show none.

THE FACE IS SF PRO, AND IT IS THE PLATFORM'S. `refkit font` returns a weak
call for SF Pro on every title measured, so the boards set in the platform
stack with no stand-in corrections: FACE_DROP and XOFF are both 0 here, and
the line-box model below is the platform face's own.

TWO SCREENS ARE MOSTLY PHOTOGRAPH. 04 is a voice-settings sheet over a 3D
companion scene, and the sheet is a dark blur of that scene rather than a
fill; 05's paywall sits on a smoke-and-particles hero that reaches faintly
down the whole screen and shows through its translucent feature card. 05's
ground is cut from the capture (crops.json) after every piece of chrome and
type on it is patched out (INPAINT below, a Coons fill from each box's own
four edges), so the pixels are the capture's and the chrome on top is CSS;
its card is not patched: its 6.7% white material is un-applied inside the
card box and re-applied by the CSS card, which is exact by construction.
04's scene is the one asset the capture does not hold: above the sheet's
edge it is the patched capture (i4), below it a gpt-image-2 edit of that
frame (assets/art/04-scene.png, composed by scratch/scene4.py), and the
sheet itself is drawn, with its blur and tint fitted (see s04).

ICONS ARE CROPS, NOT DRAWINGS, WITH TWO SETS OF EXCEPTIONS. Thirty-one glyphs on
these screens are SF Symbols, the Grok mark or its app icon, and a hand-drawn
approximation of an SF Symbol is visibly not the symbol at any zoom. Each one
is cut from its capture at its measured ink box plus a point of ground
(crops.json, the `-ic-` ids) and put back at the same numbers, so it is the
capture's own pixels and scores zero by construction.

The exceptions are vectors in assets/icons/, each with a viewBox that is its
measured ink box in pt, inlined by icon() so the canvas's inspector hands it
back as a vector asset. The three side glyphs on 04 (focus, hanger, trash) are
traced stroke by stroke against the capture's coverage, by request. The four
marks on 07's chips are not traced at all: they are the published artwork of
Gmail, GitHub, Notion and Grok Bot, each placed on the box that fits the
capture's pixels, also by request (README, "Seven vector icons").

Three defects belong to the source, not to the replica: Mobbin composites the
Dynamic Island out (except on 04, where the app's own recording dot keeps it),
drops the home indicator, and exports with square corners. All three are drawn
here. The diff window is trimmed accordingly -- see README.md.
