"""X for iOS -- a professional account, then two settings flows, in twelve screens.

Regenerates the whole folder in place, byte-identically, from anywhere:

    python3 canvases/x-ios/gen.py
    refkit tokens canvases/x-ios

Every colour and every metric in here was read off twelve Mobbin captures at
exactly 3 capture px per design pt (1179 px across a 393 pt screen, 2556 down
an 852 pt one), and every one of them is stated with its evidence on the
00b/00c boards. Nothing was eyeballed. The artboards are output: never
hand-edit an .html, edit this file and re-run.

Four decisions the captures force.

THE FACE IS THE PLATFORM'S, NOT CHIRP. X ships Chirp on the web; iOS renders
SF Pro, and every size in the Type group below was fitted to a run's measured
ink width against SF Pro at 8x rather than assumed off the iOS ladder. The
fits land inside half a pixel -- 02 "Movie review" measures 157.67 and Heavy
25.5 draws 157.62 -- which is why several sizes are halves.

ONLY PICTURES ARE CROPPED. Six crops (crops.json): 03's and 07's heroes, 10's
live-event graphic, and the three facepiles under 10's news items, each cut as
one rectangle because the discs overlap. Four more pictures are the example
account's own -- its banner on two screens, its avatar on four and its post's
video thumbnail on one -- and they come from assets/ through pic(), not from a
capture. Everything else on these screens -- every rule, fill, chip, glyph and
run of type -- is rebuilt. Where interface sat on a cropped picture it is
patched out of the capture first (INPAINT below, a Coons fill from each box's
own four edges) and drawn again in CSS on top: 03's close disc, 10's "LIVE" and
event title, and on 03 and 07 the status bar.

TWENTY-EIGHT ICONS ARE VECTORS, NOT CROPS. Each one is drawn on X's own 24-unit
grid in assets/icons/, with a viewBox that is the glyph's ink box, and inlined
by icon() at the ink box measured off the capture, so the canvas's inspector
hands it back as a vector asset. Most are approximations of X's artwork; the
five bottom-nav glyphs are not. Those are traced off the artwork at half
coverage and redrawn as lines, arcs and cubics, and the Grok mark is traced
off grok-ios's own copy of it at 165 px rather than the nav's 70 px.

THREE DEFECTS BELONG TO THE SOURCE. Mobbin composites the Dynamic Island out,
drops the home indicator, and exports with square corners. All three are this
repo's frame and are drawn here regardless, so the diff window is trimmed --
see README.md.

ONE THING THE CAPTURES DO NOT DECIDE. 01, 02 and 08-12 show @Yilin0x rather
than the captures' demo persona: its banner, its avatar, its two-line bio,
location, website, join month and counts, its handle under four settings
titles, and one post, all read off twitterapi.io. Their deltas against the
captures are therefore not clone scores -- README.md says what is still
comparable on those boards, and what the swap costs.
