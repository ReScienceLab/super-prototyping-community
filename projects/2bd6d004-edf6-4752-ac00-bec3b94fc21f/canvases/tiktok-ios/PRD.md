# TikTok

> For someone scrolling short videos and for someone about to post one, TikTok keeps the feed endless and personalized while making it fast to set up a profile and caption a new post.

## Problem
A viewer wants a feed of video that keeps being worth watching without them choosing what's next, and a creator who just recorded a clip wants to get it captioned and posted with minimal friction (a bio, hashtags, a caption) before the moment passes. Inferred from the screens; no interview.

## Users
- Primary: a viewer scrolling the For You feed, watching, scrubbing and reading captions.
- Secondary: a creator setting up their bio and captioning a post before publishing it.

## Value
For You keeps one video full-screen with everything else (scrubbing, captions, the marquee) layered on top rather than interrupting it; the bio and caption flows keep account setup and posting to a few short screens. It must never make the viewer or the poster stop and think about the interface.

## Scope
**In:** editing a profile bio (empty and filled); the profile screen; captioning a new post (empty, with keyboard, with hashtag suggestions, with caption entered); the For You feed at rest, mid-scrub, released, playing, pull-to-refresh, and the next post; a caption shown expanded and collapsed.

**Out:** recording or editing the video itself, comments, DMs, LIVE, Shop, search, notifications, the Following/Friends feed tabs.

## Success
A bio is filled in and saved rather than abandoned; a caption gets hashtags added rather than posted blank; a viewer scrubs to find a moment rather than abandoning the video; an expanded caption gets read rather than immediately collapsed again.

Bio, empty → type → Bio, filled → Profile. Profile → start a post → Post, empty → Post, keyboard → Post, hashtags → Post, caption → post (leaves this set). For You → swipe → Next post; tap-hold → Scrubbing → release → Scrub released → Playing. Tap a caption → Caption expanded ⇄ Caption collapsed.

## Open questions
Owner: product owner.

- What decides what plays next in For You — this set only shows one account's clips, not the ranking behind them.
- Can a caption be posted with zero hashtags, or are hashtags required?
- Does pull-to-refresh reload the whole feed or insert one new post?

## Riskiest assumptions
1. A viewer keeps watching without ever needing to search or browse deliberately — the feed alone is enough. Cheapest test: watch five people's first three minutes in a prototype feed and count any reach for search.
2. Hashtag suggestions get picked, rather than typed manually or skipped. Cheapest test: instrument the hashtag screen in a clickable prototype with ten testers captioning a real clip.
3. A collapsed caption is enough for most posts, and expansion is rare rather than the default reading mode. Cheapest test: show ten sample captions at the collapsed length and ask five readers whether they'd tap to expand.
