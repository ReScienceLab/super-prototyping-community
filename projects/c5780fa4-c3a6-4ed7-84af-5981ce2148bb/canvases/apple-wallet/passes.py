"""The pass templates half of canvases/apple-wallet/, boards 03-07.

Source: the Figma community file "Apple Wallet Templates", JJU4hc5PIkYLVhsGVNZYI2.
Five pass templates, one frame each, node ids per board in README.md. Unlike
apple-wallet / apple-settings / apple-calendar this file ships no dark
appearance, so every board here is light and there is no .dark block.

It also publishes no variables at all: get_variable_defs comes back empty. So
every colour is a raw hex read out of the design context and confirmed against
the file's own 2x PNG exports under assets/refs/, and every metric is a node
box confirmed the same way. Where the two disagree the export wins; the
README lists the places that mattered.

Two coordinate systems, and they are not interchangeable. Card art (logo,
company name, app icon, the info glyph, the barcode) is a child of the pass
and is placed card-relative; every "Field" instance is a child of the frame
and is placed in frame coordinates, over the card. Reading a field box as
card-relative puts it 108pt low, which the export catches immediately.

The frame is 390 x 844 with a notch, not the repo's usual 393 x 852 Dynamic
Island frame, so the phone here is 42pt-cornered and DISPLAY draws the notch.
Verify with `refkit shoot --crop-phone --phone-size 390x844 --phone-radius 42`.

letter-spacing is measured here, which no earlier run needed. Figma's own SF
Pro sets 14pt through 22pt wider than Chrome does and matches it at 12 and 40,
so LS carries one tracking token per size, solved off the export. The glyph
outlines are identical either way -- only the advances differ -- and the file's
one stated tracking, .18px on Hold Near Reader, rides on top of the 20pt
correction. See README.md.

Artboards are output. Edit this file, never the HTML.
