"""Emit canvases/apple-wallet/ from two Figma files' measurements.

One tldraw page carries both Wallet runs, because they are the same app:

    screens.py  the Wallet app itself, "Apple Wallet . iOS", light and dark
    passes.py   the five pass templates, "Apple Wallet Templates", light only

Each module owns its own TOKENS_SPEC, assets and builders and knows nothing
about the other. This file is what makes them one folder: it joins the two
:root blocks into the single block refkit's `tokens` check demands (the
prefixes --aw- and --awt- keep them apart), assigns board names across both
runs, and writes layout.json.

Artboards are output. Edit the module, never the HTML.
