# Perplexity (iOS)

> For someone who wants a synthesized answer instead of a list of links to read themselves, Perplexity is the iOS app to sign up for by email, ask by typing or voice, and keep an eye on via the Dynamic Island while a voice or reasoning query is still running, without holding the app open.

## Problem
Someone asking a question today gets a list of links from a search engine and has to read several pages themselves, or gets an AI chat answer with no way to keep working or leave the phone locked while a slower voice or reasoning query is still thinking.

## Users
- Primary: someone signing up by email and code, then asking questions from Home. Typed or by voice.
- Secondary: someone glancing at the Dynamic Island. To see whether a voice or reasoning query is still running, without opening the app.
- Secondary: someone deciding whether to buy Perplexity Pro.

## Value
Email-and-code sign-up instead of a password to manage. One Home for typed or voice queries. A Live Activity so a slow answer's progress is visible from the lock screen or another app, instead of holding Perplexity open and waiting.

## Scope
**In:** email sign-up (empty, typed, check-your-email, code entry, code accepted); the Pro paywall and its purchase-confirmed state; Home before and after the voice tooltip; the Dynamic Island for a voice session and a reasoning session, each compact and expanded.

**Out:** the answer or chat screen itself once a query is open, account settings, canceling or managing a subscription, social sign-in beyond the pills shown on the splash, search history.

## Success
A new signer-up reaches Home without getting stuck at the code step; someone glancing at a compact island can tell a voice session from a reasoning session without opening the app; someone who dismisses the Home tooltip doesn't need it shown again to know where voice entry is.

## Screens
| Screen | Purpose | States |
|---|---|---|
| Splash | App launch, sign-in options | four sign-in pills |
| Continue with email | Email sign-in field | empty, keyboard up |
| Address typed | Email sign-in field | address typed, button live |
| Check your email | Confirmation a code was sent | envelope lockup |
| Enter code | Code-entry field | focused, caret (not mocked: wrong code) |
| Code accepted | Code submitted | spinner, no caret |
| Perplexity Pro | Subscription paywall | serif hero, chip rows, two plans |
| Purchase confirmed | The paywall dimmed under the purchase alert | scrim + iOS alert on top |
| Home, voice tooltip | Home screen | tooltip pointing at voice entry |
| Home | Home screen at rest | tooltip dismissed |
| Voice, compact | Dynamic Island, a live voice session | collapsed pill |
| Voice, expanded | Dynamic Island, a live voice session | expanded panel |
| Reasoning, compact | Dynamic Island, a live reasoning session | collapsed pill |
| Reasoning, expanded | Dynamic Island, a live reasoning session | expanded panel, progress row |

Continue with email → Address typed → (submit) Check your email → Enter code → Code accepted → Home. Home shows the voice tooltip (Home, voice tooltip) until dismissed (Home). Starting a voice or reasoning query from Home shows a Live Activity on the Dynamic Island — Voice compact ↔ expanded, or Reasoning compact ↔ expanded — while the app is backgrounded or the phone is locked. Where the Pro paywall is reached from is not shown by these boards.

## Open questions
- What the answer or chat screen itself looks like once a query completes. Not in scope of these boards.
- What happens on a wrong code. Not shown; only the accepted path is mocked.
- Where the paywall sits in the flow — first run, after a number of free queries, or opt-in from settings. Not shown by these boards alone.

## Riskiest assumptions
1. A one-time email code is an acceptable primary sign-up step alongside the Apple/Google pills shown on the splash. Cheapest test: measure completion on the pill path versus the email-code path.
2. Users will pay for Pro on first paywall exposure rather than needing a free-use period first. Cheapest test: A/B the paywall's timing — immediate versus after N free queries.
3. A Live Activity is something people leave running and glance at, rather than dismiss. Cheapest test: measure island engagement versus dismiss rate in a beta.
