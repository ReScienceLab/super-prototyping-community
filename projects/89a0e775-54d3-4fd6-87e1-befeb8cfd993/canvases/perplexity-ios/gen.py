"""Emit canvases/perplexity-ios/ from ten Perplexity iOS captures.

The onboarding flow end to end: the splash, email entry empty and filled, the
"check your email" pane and its two code states, the Pro paywall with and
without its purchase alert, and the home screen with and without the voice
tooltip.

...and four Dynamic Island states: the voice Live Activity and the reasoning
one, each compact and expanded.

The first ten captures are 1180 x 2676 from Mobbin -- a 1179 x 2556 iPhone
screen at @3x with a 120px attribution bar under it. The island four are
881 x 2000, an 881 x 1910 screen under a 90px bar. Two scales, so `scale`
reads it off the capture's name; the frame is this repo's 393 x 852 pt either
way.

    python3 canvases/perplexity-ios/gen.py

Text is placed by the *ink* top measured off the capture, not by the line box:
`ink()` converts one to the other for a line whose line-height equals its font
size. Every other number in here is design pt read straight off a capture.

Artboards are output. Edit this file, never the HTML.
