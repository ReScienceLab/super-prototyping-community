# Raycast iOS: Ask AI, models & presets

A `sp-clone-prototype` run over eleven Raycast iOS screens in three flows: the Ask
AI conversation (select a note, type a prompt, watch the answer stream in, act
on it), the Models bottom sheet, and the Presets picker. Two foundation boards
plus eleven replicas, every colour and metric traced to a sample off the
source capture.

Open it with `?canvas=raycast-ios`.

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `00-design-tokens.html` | The contract. Swatches, type ramp, radii, metrics. Inlined byte-identically into all eleven screens. |
| `00b-evidence.html` | The measurement behind every token. Split off its own board once screens 07–11 doubled the token count past what a 478 × 980 shape can hold. |
| `01-ask-anything` … `06-answer-scrolled` | Ask AI. |
| `07-models-sheet` … `08-home-composer` | Model switching: the Models sheet over a dimmed launcher, then the launcher itself. |
| `09-presets-opening` … `11-home-perplexity` | Presets: the list mid-transition, the full list, and the launcher after Perplexity is picked. |

Capture scale is `1179 / 393 = 3.0` px/pt, native @3x, cross-checked against
height (`2556 / 852 = 3.0`), so ink and hairlines could be picked directly
instead of solved for. Two values still needed work:

- `--rc-border: #E4E4E4` came out of a 1pt coverage solve on the Copy pill's
  outline (79 total deficit over 3 px). A naive pick reports it far too light.
- Everything behind the sheet sits under `--rc-scrim: rgba(0,0,0,.20)`, so every
  colour sampled there was divided by 0.8 before becoming a token. The toolbar
  pill reads 198 in the capture and is `#F6F6F6` in the UI. The Models sheet
  confirms it from the other side: `#EFEFEF` launcher ground reads `#BEBEBE`
  under the scrim, `1 − 190/239 = .205`.

The keyboard is worth a note. A flat-neighbour census proved every key,
including shift, backspace, `123`, return and space, is pure `#FFFFFF` on an
`#E3E5E6` ground, with no keycap shadow. The dark modifier keys and drop
shadows that iOS keyboards usually carry are not in these frames.

## Screens 07–11: two things the earlier six did not need

**Brand marks.** Ten of the eleven preset rows are third-party logos. They are
inline SVG paths from [lobehub/icons](https://lobehub.com/icons) (served as
`@lobehub/icons-static-svg`), one per row, recoloured to a value sampled off the
capture; the Raycast mark itself is not in that set and comes from
[simple-icons](https://simpleicons.org). Two traps. Lobehub's `grok` icon is
the swirl, not the mark in this capture; the frame shows the xAI "X", which is
`xai.svg`. And simple-icons' Raycast path fills its inner square under both
fill rules, so the generator knocks that square out with an SVG `<mask>` to
leave the L bracket.

**Blur.** The Presets screens sit on a blurred launcher rather than a scrim.
`filter: blur(26px)` over the real launcher markup reproduces the colour blobs
where a flat fill cannot, and a 140px white ramp (`.62 → .30 → 0` over
60 / 98 / 134px) lifts the nav strip to the measured `#FBF8FB` without washing
the purple blob out. The list's bottom rows fade under a `mask-image` ramp;
`backdrop-filter` does nothing inside a masked element, so the last row is
blurred directly with `filter: blur(4.6px)`.

## Known differences from the source

- **No Dynamic Island and no home indicator.** Mobbin masks both out of these
  captures. The pixel where the island would sit reads as plain scrim, so the
  replica omits them rather than inventing them.
- **Device corner radius.** The capture's corners are ≈ 60 pt; the repo's shared
  phone frame is 52 pt. The frame was left alone, so the answer sheet's bottom
  corners clip a little differently than in the source.
- Type is Inter / Helvetica Neue against the capture's SF Pro. Line breaks are
  forced with `<br>` and `white-space: nowrap` so the wraps match the source
  string for string regardless of the substituted face; measured line widths
  land within ~1.5%. `refkit font` puts a number on how close the substitution
  is: on `about-01`'s 13pt row label it ranks SF Pro 0.837 against Inter 0.806
  and reports **no call**. The two are inseparable at that size. It is not a
  limit of the matcher; the same command on a Notion capture separates the two
  cleanly, 0.865 to 0.717.
- **The presets backdrop is desaturated.** `refkit diff` puts mean chroma at
  2.0 against the source's 5.9. A single CSS Gaussian under two white veils
  spreads the launcher's colour blobs but bleaches them, and below y 560 the
  replica is effectively neutral where the source still carries a tint.
  Luminance is not the problem. Mean brightness matches to 0.1, and only the
  y 240–320 band runs measurably dark (−2.5).

## The reference row is not checked in

Phase 5 parks each source capture in its own `ref-NN-<slug>.html` and adds a
third `layout.json` row listing them **in the same order as the replica row**,
so item N lands directly under item N and the two can be read against each
other. `layout.json` here keeps that row.

The `ref-*.html` files themselves are gitignored. They embed third-party app
screenshots from Mobbin's library, which this repo does not redistribute.
Regenerate them locally from your own captures. The skill's Phase 0 and
Phase 5 have the embedding steps.

Sources for this run were user-supplied Mobbin captures of the Raycast iOS Ask
AI flow (`asking-ai-02` … `asking-ai-07`), the model picker
(`changing-a-model-01`, `-02`) and the preset picker (`changing-a-preset-01`
… `-03`), uncropped so the attribution watermark is retained in the reference
boards. All eleven are the exact frames being cloned, no near-matches.
