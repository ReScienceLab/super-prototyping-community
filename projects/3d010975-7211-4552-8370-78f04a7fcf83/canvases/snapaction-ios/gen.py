"""SnapAction, iOS: six screens rebuilt from the App Store frames of one Figma
file, plus the token board, the three evidence boards and the six captures.

    python3 canvases/snapaction-ios/gen.py

regenerates the folder in place, byte-identical, from anywhere: every path
resolves against __file__. The .html files are output. Never hand-edit one --
edit this file and re-run.

Two frame sizes, because the source uses two devices: 440 x 956 pt for the
timeline screens (01, 02) and 430 x 932 for the rest. Both sit on the same
12px ring inside the canvas' 478 x 980 shape box, so 956 + 24 = 980 lands
exactly and nothing clips.

With assets/refs/ present the run also re-cuts assets/art/ from crops.json and
emits the six ref-* boards; without it (a fresh clone: the captures are whole
app screens and are gitignored) it uses the committed art and skips them.

# follow the size, so no K can absorb it - t-code at 13px wants its run 0.33
# higher and t-meta at 12.65px wants its own 0.23 lower - and together the
# fifteen take the five device screens from 10.17 to 8.88. The same pass
# measured each run's left edge too; every token came back inside a third of
# a point, and sweeping the corrections in moved no frame by more than 0.03,
# so the left bearing is one number, LSB, for the whole board.

# ------------------------------------------------------------- launch ----
# The one screen with no capture behind it, because it is ours: the source is
# the source. LaunchBrandView.swift paints Color(.systemBackground) and one
# BrandLockup, and brings it in with
#     withAnimation(.easeOut(duration: 0.3)) { appeared = true }
# over opacity 0 -> 1 and scaleEffect 0.98 -> 1; RootFlowView then cross-fades
# the whole state out with .easeInOut(duration: 0.2) when restoreSession()
# returns. These two boards are the state that animation rests at, held still
# in both appearances; the timings are in the README.
#
# Two boards because the lockup is Color(.label) on Color(.systemBackground)
# and nothing else, so the whole screen is one system colour pair inverted,
# which is why the source reaches for the monochrome symbol rather than the
# full-colour ProductLogo. Both halves of the pair are already tokens: label
# light is --x-bg and systemBackground light is --x-l-bg, the same two hexes
# the dark board uses the other way round.
#
# SnapActionLogoSymbol.symbolset, group Regular-S, lifted out of its
# matrix(1 0 0 1 1404.51 696) so the local origin is the baseline at the left
# margin. The template's guides put Baseline-S at y 696 and Capline-S at
# 625.541, so one unit is one pt at point size 100 and the cap height is
# 70.459; left-margin-Regular-S 1404.51 to right-margin-Regular-S 1495.18
# makes the advance 90.67. Black-S and Ultralight-S are the same 3433
# characters of path at a different x, so the mark does not vary with weight
# and Regular-S stands in for .semibold.

# ---------------------------------------------------------- the product ----
# Not a replica of anything, and the only board here that is not measured
# against a capture. SnapAction is ReScience Lab's own app, so this one is the
# thing itself: the App Store listing's own copy and icon, and two QR codes
# built from the URLs and decoded back with Vision to prove they carry them.
# It is a landscape banner rather than a phone, 4 x 478 + 3 x 80 wide so it
# spans the foundations row exactly, and layout.json carries its size and the
# two buttons the canvas draws under it (a board is sandboxed, so a link in
# the markup could never navigate; the clickable part has to be a shape).
#
# The foot of it is the one measurement on the board. snapaction.ai publishes
# its palette as oklch custom properties; converted to sRGB they are not the
# app's, and a marketing site drifting from the product it sells is exactly
# the kind of thing the rest of this folder exists to catch.
