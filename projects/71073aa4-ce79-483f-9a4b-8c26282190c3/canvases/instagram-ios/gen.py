"""Instagram for iOS: fourteen screens, rebuilt from Mobbin captures.

Eight are one account's profile. Six are the feed: the Following/Favorites
switcher open over the home feed, the two feeds it opens, and the two
fullscreen reels views. A fifteenth is the profile layout carrying a live
account instead of a capture.

    python3 canvases/instagram-ios/gen.py

regenerates every board in place, byte-identical, from anywhere. Boards are
output; never hand-edit the .html.

What is measured and what is not. Every colour, baseline, box and pitch in
here came off assets/refs/cNN.png -- the fourteen captures at 1179 x 2556, three
capture pixels per design point -- and the measurement that justifies it is in
probes.json, replayable with `refkit batch`. The one thing not measured here
is the iOS status bar: it is this repo's shared chrome, copied unchanged from
templates/gen.py, clock and all. The captures carry no home indicator (Mobbin
strips it), so neither do these boards.

What is cropped and what is rebuilt. Only photography and editorial art are
cropped: the boxes in crops.json, cut out of the captures and placed back by
art() at the same numbers, so an asset cannot drift from where it was measured.
Everything else is live -- type, buttons, rings, the tab bar, the grid's
play/carousel/pin badges and the reels view counts. Interface set on a
photograph is listed in that crop's `erase`, inpainted out of it and redrawn on
top: on the feed boards that is every line of type over a post. A ring, an
outlined pill and an opaque badge are not erased, because the live element
covers its own pixels one to one and the erase would take the video out of the
hole it leaves.

Where the icons come from. 34 of the 44 SVGs in assets/icons are Meta's own
IGDS drawings, lifted out of the IGDS*Icon.react modules in the JS the
logged-out instagram.com shell loads, except threads-note, which only
threads.com carries; the other 10 are traced or drawn from the captures,
because they only appear behind the login wall. icon() sets preserveAspectRatio="none", so
each file's viewBox is the glyph's ink box, never a module's design grid --
see the folder README.

Board 15 is the exception to all of that. It has no capture behind it: it is
the geometry boards 01, 06 and 07 were measured at, filled with what the
profile API returns for one live account, so it carries no delta, no probe and
no crop. Its pictures are that API's own files, in assets/photo.

The scroll model. Boards 03-05 are board 01 scrolled by exactly 208.33 pt:
the mutuals row, the buttons and the highlights all move by that one number,
and the nav is opaque, so nothing above the mutuals survives. Board 02 is the
same account scrolled far enough that the tab bar sticks under the nav; its
first grid row is board 01's second, which is why boards 01 and 02 share the
crops ig-t4..ig-t6.

# 600/15 on a baseline 35.33 below the widget top, and the corner mark is
# inset 19 from the top-right. Nothing casts a shadow: the ground reads 100%
# flat right up to the corner, which is why --x-home can be one token.
