# Apple Home & Lock Screen

The iOS 17 home and lock screens, cloned from the Figma community file
"Apple Home and Lock Screen · iOS" (file key `ftV2wtqJaMqjnFaf8SS1Ve`,
node `6:389`, the Overview page). The source is a design file, so the
references are the file's own 3× exports and every token is a Figma value
re-checked by a probe on those exports (`probes.json`, 54 entries).

Nodes: `6:436` home light, `6:437` home dark, `6:456` lock light, `6:458`
lock dark, `6:440` / `6:441` / `6:442` the home screen in Spanish, Chinese
and French.

## Boards

- `00-design-tokens`, `00b-evidence`: 59 tokens with one evidence row each.
- `01`–`04`: home and lock, light and dark. The dark boards inline the same
  `:root` and remap nine tokens under `.dark`.
- `05`–`07`: the home screen with the file's Spanish, Chinese and French
  strings. Those exports are 430 × 932 instances (iPhone 15 Pro Max); the
  boards keep the 393 layout and swap the strings.
- `ref-01`..`ref-07`: the exports, one under each screen. Gitignored with
  `assets/refs/`; a fresh clone has 9 boards.

## Numbers

Renders at 3× (`refkit shoot --scale 3 --crop-phone`) against the exports,
whole frame, phone corners masked:

| board | export | mean Δ (of 255) | worst 40 px band |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 home light | 6:436, 1179 × 2556 | 2.61 | y 27–40, Δ 29.5: the island, which the export's 430 bar puts 18.5 pt further right |
| 02 home dark | 6:437 | 2.48 | the same band, Δ 29.8 |
| 03 lock light | 6:456 | 1.49 | y 133–147, Δ 9.8: the clock's digits |
| 04 lock dark | 6:458 | 1.49 | y 133–147, Δ 9.8 |
| 05–07 | 6:440–6:442, 1290 × 2796 | not diffed | a 430-wide instance is not the board's frame |

Below the status bar the home boards read as before; the next band is the
reminder and event rows at Δ 11.8. The bar is the one deliberate departure
from the file, explained below.

Probe replay (`refkit batch probes.json --against scratch/shots --pt 3`):
38 colour probes, mean Δmax 1.3; 12 box probes, mean |dw| 0.16 pt, |dh| 0.14;
4 scans. The two that do not read 0–2 are noise, kept with their notes:

- `search-out` Δ 14 and `divider` Δ 9: `sample` reports a census mode, and a
  10 × 22 pt window inside a wallpaper gradient has no stable mode. The window
  means agree (125.5 / 227.8 / 252.4 against 125.6 / 227.5 / 252.0).
## What the file leaves unsaid

- **The home frame sits under the status bar.** Every top-anchored y in the
  Figma context is 54 short of the export: the first probe pass returned
  wallpaper ink for every widget window until all home windows moved +54.
- **The home frames carry the 430 status bar.** The file drops its
  "15 Pro Max" variant into the 393 home frames, left-aligned: island
  126 × 37 at x 152, an 18 px time centred at x 81, icon boxes at 303 / 333 /
  359. The lock frames use the 393 variant (island at 133.5, icons at 282.6 /
  309.1 / 332.9). The boards set the 393 bar on every screen, the one the
  other canvases use, so the row lines up on the welcome page; the home
  exports differ from the boards in that band, which is the residual in the
  top 54 pt of 01, 02 and 05–07. Both bars are built from the file's own wifi
  and battery SVGs plus four rects at its cellular insets.
- **The date and time add to the wallpaper.** The fill is
  `rgba(255,255,255,.8)`, but the export's brightest date pixels are
  `#FFCFEB`, which is 204 plus the backdrop, clipped; a normal composite
  reads `#DDCCD1`. The text blends `plus-lighter`.
- **The drag bar is two blend layers.** `rgba(127,127,127,.5)` at
  luminosity under `#C2C2C2` at overlay, which the composite `#D94652` over
  `#85040C` confirms. They sit beside the wallpaper in the phone's stacking
  context; inside the status bar container they blend against nothing.
- **"SF Pro" is the variable face.** With Chrome's optical sizing it sets
  the date 170.3 wide against 170.7, "Shortcuts" 53.7 against 53.3 and the
  100 px clock 175.0 against 174.7. Static SF Pro Display misses the date by
  5.4, SF Pro Text by 13.6. The status time is the 393 bar's SemiBold 17,
  as on the other canvases.
- **Dark is not the light alpha.** The dark event background `#1C445B` is
  .28 of `#1BADF8` over `#1C1C1E`, not the light board's .2.
- **The strings are transcribed as the file has them.** The Chinese export
  labels News 消息 and App Store 预览, the Spanish export lists the reminders
  as Caminar, Yoga, Duolingo. The Walk emoji is the neutral 🚶🏻 (the export's
  figure wears jeans), rendered by the platform's Apple Color Emoji.

## Assets

- `wp-light.webp`, `wp-dark.webp`: the file's wallpaper PNGs (1179 × 2556)
  at WebP q88, 35 / 31 KB, mean delta 0.64 / 0.63 against the PNG. Home and
  lock share one image per appearance.
- `logo-*.webp`: the 18 app icons at 180 × 180, q90, 49 KB in all.
- `sb-*.svg`: the wifi and battery glyphs from the file's SVG export of the
  393 bar.
- `icon.png`: the welcome card's sticker, built by `gen.py` from a square of
  the wallpaper and a white 17 in SF Pro Display Bold, in the 256 px squircle
  the other Apple folders use.
- `art/`: the flashlight, camera and search glyphs, keyed out of the exports
  at the boxes in `crops.json` (`gen.py` solves alpha against the disc
  behind each one) and placed back at the same numbers.

`assets/refs/` holds the exports (`home-light`, `home-dark`, `lock-light`,
`lock-dark`, `home-es`, `home-zh`, `home-fr` as PNG). Without them `gen.py`
skips the glyph cut and the `ref-*` boards and still writes everything else.
